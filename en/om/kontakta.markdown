There are several ways to contact the team behind the license...

## Discuss
Questions about how to use the license, specific parts of the license or API licenses in general can be discussed in [our Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/259132024222457/). Beware that most discussions in that group will be in Swedish but feel free to ask questions in English as well. 

## Report and fix bugs
If you find anything wrong in the license, the documentation or on this site please create a new *issue* for the relevant repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/apilicense). Since everything is open source we would very much appreciate if you can fix whatever is wrong and let us know so we can incorporate your fix.

## Do you use the License?
Mail us at [info@apilicens.se](mailto:info@apilicens.se) with information about your API and how you are using the Swedish API License and we would love to list you as an example of how the License can be used.

## Other Questions
If the  [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/259132024222457/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/apilicense) do not fit the bill then go ahead and send a mail to [info@apilicens.se](mailto:info@apilicens.se).
